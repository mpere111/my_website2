# 4. Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_parable.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten.

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we will use the `tidyquant` package to download monthly rates for different durations. 

```{r get_rates, warning=FALSE}
# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency
# to see, eg., the 3-month T-bill https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS
tickers <- c('TB3MS', # 3-month Treasury bill (or T-bill)
             'TB6MS', # 6-month
             'GS1',   # 1-year
             'GS2',   # 2-year, etc....
             'GS3',
             'GS5',
             'GS7',
             'GS10',
             'GS20',
             'GS30')  #.... all the way to the 30-year rate

# Turn  FRED codes to human readable variables
myvars <- c('3-Month Treasury Bill',
            '6-Month Treasury Bill',
            '1-Year Treasury Rate',
            '2-Year Treasury Rate',
            '3-Year Treasury Rate',
            '5-Year Treasury Rate',
            '7-Year Treasury Rate',
            '10-Year Treasury Rate',
            '20-Year Treasury Rate',
            '30-Year Treasury Rate')

maturity <- c('3m', '6m', '1y', '2y','3y','5y','7y','10y','20y','30y')

# by default R will sort these maturities alphabetically; but since we want
# to keep them in that exact order, we recast maturity as a factor 
# or categorical variable, with the levels defined as we want
maturity <- factor(maturity, levels = maturity)

# Create a lookup dataset
mylookup<-data.frame(symbol=tickers,var=myvars, maturity=maturity)
# Take a look:
mylookup %>% 
  knitr::kable()

df <- tickers %>% tidyquant::tq_get(get="economic.data", 
                   from="1960-01-01")   # start from January 1960

glimpse(df)
```

Our dataframe `df` has three columns (variables):

- `symbol`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `date`: already a date object
- `price`: the actual yield on that date

The first thing would be to join this dataframe `df` with the dataframe `mylookup` so we have a more readable version of maturities, durations, etc.


```{r join_data, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <-left_join(df,mylookup,by="symbol") 
```

## Plotting the yield curve

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

We want to reproduce the following graph:

```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)
```


```{r graph1_yield_curve, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
yield_curve$var <- factor(yield_curve$var, levels =myvars)

ggplot(yield_curve, aes(x=date, y=price, colour = var))+
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE, group=1)+
  facet_wrap(~var, ncol = 2)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Yields on U.S. Treasury rates since 1960", 
       caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)",
       x="",
       y="%")
```



### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis

We want to reproduce the following graph:

```{r yield_curve_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r, challenge1_plot2, fig.width=10}

library(lubridate)

plot2 <- yield_curve%>%
  mutate(year = year(date), 
         month = month(date))%>%
filter(year >= 1999)

ggplot(plot2, aes(x=maturity, 
                  y=price, 
                  colour=year, 
                  group=date))+
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 4)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title= "US Yield Curve",
       caption = "Source: St. Loius Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)",
       x= "Maturity",
       y= "Yield (%)")+
  scale_color_gradientn(colours = rainbow(30))


```



### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

We want to reproduce the following graph:

```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve3.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r plot3, fig.width=15, fig.height=12}

plot3 <- plot2%>%
  filter(maturity %in% c("3m", "10y"))

ggplot(plot3, aes(x=date, y=price, colour= var))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())+
  labs(title = "Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999",
       caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)",
       x="",
       y="%")

```

To plot our final graph we will

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

recessions <- recessions%>%
  filter(year(from) >=1960)
```

Then we continue to plot the graph:

```{r , plot4, fig.width=15}
plot4 <- yield_curve%>%
  select(date, symbol, price)%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = price)%>%
  mutate(diff = GS10 - TB3MS)
  
ggplot(plot4, aes(x=date, y=diff))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=0),color="black")+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax=ifelse(diff>0, diff,0)),fill="blue",alpha=0.2)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=ifelse(diff<0, diff,0),ymax=0),fill="red",alpha=0.2)  +
  geom_rect(data=recessions, 
            inherit.aes = FALSE, 
            aes(ymin=-Inf, 
                ymax= Inf, 
                xmin=From, 
                xmax=To), 
            fill = "black", 
            alpha = 0.2)+
  theme_bw()+
  scale_x_date(date_breaks="2 years",date_labels="%Y")+
  labs(title = "Yield Curve Inversion: 10-year minus3-month U.S. Treasury rates",
       subtitle = "Difference in % points, monthly averages.\nShaded areas correspond to recessions",
       caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)",
       x="",
       y="Difference (10 year-3 month) yield in %")
 
  
```
This graph shows us that the yield curve actually flattens before recessions. Therefore, a flatten of the yield curve can predict an upcoming recession.
Furthermore, since 1999 the 3-month yield more than a 10-year:
- 2000
- 2006-2007
